Digital Image Processing :: Getting Started
===========================================

These guides will introduce you to the basic tools needed to complete the digital image processing assignments in `TDT4195`_ using either `Python`_ or `MATLAB`_.

Python
======

Simply open the `Jupyter notebook`_ on GitHub to start reading.

If you want to run the `Jupyter`_ notebook on your local machine you will have to: (i) clone the repository and (ii) start Jupyter via the terminal using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  jupyter notebook

When Jupyter is running, you can point your web browser at ``http://localhost:8888`` to start using the notebook. The front page displays all available Jupyter notebooks in the current directory. You may have to change directory to find the notebook you want to read.

The above assumes that Jupyter notebook has been installed. This can, for example, be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install jupyter

As mentioned in the notebook, **Shift-Enter** will run the currently selected cell.


MATLAB
======

Open the `MATLAB guide`_ and start reading. If you want to execute the code locally you will have to copy and paste the relevant blocks of code.
